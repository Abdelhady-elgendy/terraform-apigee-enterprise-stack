# Terraform Apigee Enterprise Stack - Wiki

Welcome to the enterprise wiki for the Terraform Apigee Enterprise Stack. This wiki is designed for platform and security teams that need a repeatable, secure, and auditable way to deploy Apigee X on Google Cloud.

## Why this exists

Most enterprise Apigee rollouts fail or stall for the same reasons: network prerequisites are unclear, IAM is inconsistent, and deployment steps are spread across multiple docs and scripts. This wiki centralizes the plan and explains how to run the stack in a way that is repeatable across dev, test, and prod.
